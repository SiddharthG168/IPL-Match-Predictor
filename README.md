python match.py

Data:

The data for the simulation is located in the data folders

Batting clusters

Bowling clusters

PlayeVsPlayer data

GroupVsGroup data


Input:

The matches are simulated using the csv files

Ex MIvsDD.csv

If you want to simulate a different match, then the code is replaced with the respective csv file.

The matches' csv files are made from taking the batting and bowling orders of the respective teams from 'teams.ods' and creating a new csv file which is used as input to the match.py code.
